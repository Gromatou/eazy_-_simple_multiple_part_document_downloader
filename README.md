Hey ! i'm a noob. i've made this little python programe (my first one) to download all parts of a document.
for exemple, i've a book but all pages are at different url : 
https://www.editions-hatier.fr/flip/flex/docs/c/9782401053779/9782401053779_03.pdf
===============================================================page number  â†‘ 
my program will ask u for the beginning of the url (https://www.editions-hatier.fr/flip/flex/docs/c/9782401053779/9782401053779_) and, 
the end of url (03.pdf) and, the number of page and, the file extention.
the program will download all ur page in the folder. after that u have to combine all or use ocr to make a smoth pdf file.
(i recomand gscan2pdf iclud ocr and image to pdf and merging )
if u have some ideas to make my code better tell me, i'm a noob, so you will need to explaine all step by step.
